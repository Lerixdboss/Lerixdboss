We will endeavour to process all subject access requests within thirty (30) days and if any further extension is required, we will communicate same through existing consented channels ‚Äì at no cost. However, please note that you may continue to receive existing communications for a transitional period whilst we update your preferences.

RETENTION OF YOUR DATA
We will not retain your personal data for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which such personal data is processed. This means that your personal data will only be retained for as long as it is still required to provide you with the Services or is necessary for legal reasons. When calculating the appropriate retention period of your personal data we consider the nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the purposes for which we are processing such personal data, and any applicable statutory/regulatory retention periods. Using these criteria, we regularly review the personal data that we hold and the purposes for which such is held and processed. Our Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (‚ÄúPCIDSS‚Äù) obligation means that we are obliged to retain personal data for a minimum of ten (10) years from the end date of our business relationship with you. 

When we determine that personal data can no longer be retained (or where you request that we delete your personal data in accordance with your rights contained in Data Protection Laws) we ensure that such personal data is securely deleted, anonymized or destroyed. However, please note that, in some circumstances we may decide to retain your personal data as may be reasonably necessary in accordance with the provisions of Data Protection Laws. In such circumstances, we will anonymize your personal data before retaining same.

Please see details of our data retention and disposal process below: 

Type of data
Retention Period
Disposal Process
Electronic storage on database

(regulatory reasons)

Programmatic (automatic) process to remove, at least on a quarterly basis, personal data that exceeds business retention requirements/reviews conducted at least on a quarterly basis

year 
On at least a quarterly basis, we systematically remove and destroy all cardholder data that has exceeded its retention period, and review and ensure the remaining stored cardholder data remains within the formal retention requirements. 

Wherever the primary account number (‚ÄúPAN‚Äù) is stored, whether electronically or on paper, it is masked. The first six and last four digits are the maximum number of digits that may be displayed. Certain members of the operations and Service delivery units have a legitimate business need when dealing with customer/cardholder enquiries to access the PAN. Wherever the PAN is stored (including in logs, removable media, etc.), it is made unreadable by means of one-way hashes. Cardholder data is never stored on removable media and when removable physical storage media (including documents, faxes, and electronic media) are no longer required (i.e. they have passed their retention periods), they are destroyed. 





ACCURACY OF YOUR DATA
It is important that the personal data Moniepoint MFB holds about you is accurate and current. Please keep Moniepoint MFB informed if any aspect of your personal data changes at any time during your relationship with us. On our customer facing products, you can easily update your personal data yourself or alternatively contact our Data Protection Officer via dpo@moniepoint.com when you want to exercise your right of rectification.

SECURITY OF YOUR DATA
In order to protect your personal data, we have put in place appropriate organisational and technical security measures. These measures include storing data on a dedicated and secure server with at least 256-bit encryption, restricting access to your personal data to certain employees, ensuring that our internal information technology systems are suitably secure, and implementing procedures to deal with any suspected data breach.

In the unlikely event of a data breach, Moniepoint MFB will take steps to mitigate any loss or destruction of data and, if appropriate, will notify you and any applicable authority of such a breach.

DATA TRANSFERS AND SHARING
Due to the fact that we operate in a regulated environment, we cannot ensure that all your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government, regulatory bodies, law enforcement agencies, and third parties for the performance of a task carried out in the interest of the public, for the protection of your vital interest, for the performance of a contract which you are a party to and also where you have expressly given us written consent to disclose same.

We may need to pass your information to third party service providers which maintain, administer or develop the Sites on our behalf and the information will only be provided for such limited purposes and as detailed below. Additionally, we may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related website information to reputable third-parties, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information.

Moniepoint MFB may transfer your personal data to third parties (‚ÄúThird Party Providers‚Äù) of the following types:

companies providing identity or financial validation services;
financial product providers;
payment services companies acting on your, or our behalf;
banks;
companies providing analytics services;
data, service and software providers;
companies collecting and publishing customer reviews;
marketing services companies; and 
Regulatory and law enforcement bodies.
A few of our identity verification Third Party Providers collect your personal data via our Sites through the use of Apple Inc. 's (‚ÄúApple‚Äù) TrueDepth Application Programming Interface (‚ÄúTrueDepth API‚Äù). As a result of the integration of our Sites with such Third Party Providers, our Sites make use of automatically collected information using the device camera on your Apple mobile device and the TrueDepth API provided by Apple. 

The use of your personal data collected as a result of this is to track your facial features, and control the augmented reality (AR) experience. We use ARKit to capture your face 3D spatial orientation and facial expressions. In doing this, we use this data to ensure that the picture (selfie) being taken is of a live user for authentication and fraud reduction purposes. The ARKit information is processed entirely locally and the spatial orientation/facial expression data is not submitted to any third (or first) parties. None of the information collected by the TrueDepth API ever leaves your mobile device nor is it persistently stored on the device. 

We will do our reasonable best to ensure personal data provided by you to us and shared with a Third Party Provider is done in accordance with the provisions of Data Protection Laws. We will also reasonably ensure that such Third Party Providers with whom we share your personal data will ensure the security of the same as provided by this Policy and in accordance with Data Protection Laws. 

CONFIDENTIALITY
You further acknowledge that the Sites may contain information which is designated confidential by us and that you shall not disclose such information without our prior written consent. Your information is regarded as confidential and therefore will not be divulged to any third party, unless if legally required to do so to the appropriate authorities. We will not sell, share, or rent your personal data to any third party nor use your email address for unsolicited mail. Any emails sent by us will only be in connection with the provision of agreed Services.

We take all necessary precautions to protect your personal information both online and off-line. It is important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your password, your mobile phone or computer. Be sure to log off from the Sites when you are using a shared phone/computer. We also protect your personal data off-line. Access to your personal data is limited to employees, agents or partners and third parties with whom we are working who we reasonably believe will need that information to provide the Services to you. 

COOKIES
We use data collection devices such as ‚Äòcookies‚Äô on certain pages of the Sites. Cookies are small files stored on your hard drive that assist us in providing Services customised to your requirements and tastes. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a ‚Äòcookie‚Äô. Cookies can also help us provide information, which is targeted to your interests. Cookies may be used whether you choose to register with Us or not. 

We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Most cookies are ‚Äòsession cookies‚Äô, meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Sites and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Use of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on the Sites. Once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on your browser, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on the Sites. 

You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you reject the cookies on the Sites, you may still be able to use the Sites, but it shall be limited to certain minimal functionality. The only drawback to this is that you may be limited to some areas of Sites or limited to certain functions of the Sites.

JOB APPLICANTS
If you apply for a job at Moniepoint MFB, you will be asked to submit information to Moniepoint MFB such as your name, contact details, information about your education and work history and any other background information that might be relevant to your application or that you choose to share with us. If you do not provide this information to us, we might not be able to process your application.

We will use this information to assess your application and candidacy for the position you have applied for. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this may include:

Evaluating your skills and experience in relation to the qualification required for the job you have applied for; and
Tracking feedback and interactions, we have with you throughout the recruiting process. We may also use your information when analysing our internal recruitment processes to determine:
Which recruitment sources to focus on;
How to improve integration and training programs for new hires with different educational backgrounds and work experience; and

The information you provide may also be used to communicate with you about Moniepoint MFB‚Äôs events and to send you publications that we think may be of interest to you.

We might share your personal data with other companies in our group as well as with third parties such as recruitment service providers, background check providers and information technology system providers. These Moniepoint MFB group companies and third parties might be located in a different country than your country of residence.

We will keep your application data for up to one (1) year. If you no longer wish for Moniepoint MFB to process your personal data or if you wish to exercise any of your rights as a data subject, please contact dpo@moniepoint.com. 

DISCLAIMER
We will keep your information secure by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage. We will do our best to protect your personal data, but we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data which is transmitted to other websites via an internet or similar connection. If we have given you (or you have chosen) a password to access certain areas of the Sites please keep this password safe, we will not share this password with anyone.

As a user of the Services, you understand and agree that you assume all responsibility and risk attached to safeguarding your account with us. You shall at no time whatsoever disclose your password to anyone, nor shall you allow anyone make use of your account.

UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY
We are constantly trying to improve our Sites and Services, so we may need to change this Policy from time to time as well. We will alert you of material changes by, for example, placing a notice on our websites and/or by sending you an email (if you have registered your e-mail details with us) when we are required to do so by applicable law. We reserve the right to update this Policy as we deem fit, from time to time, without any intimation to you and your continued use of the Sites will signify your acceptance of any amendment to these terms. 

Our updated terms will also be displayed on our website (www.moniepoint.com/ng) It is your responsibility to check this Privacy Policy from time to time to verify such updates.

If you believe at any time that we have not handled your personal data in accordance with this Policy, please contact our Data Protection Officer.

We have appointed a Data Protection Officer (DPO) who is responsible for dealing with all such concerns, in addition to overseeing questions relating to this Policy and handling requests in relation to the exercise of your rights. If you have any concerns or questions, please contact the Data Protection Officer using the details set out below.
